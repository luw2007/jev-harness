# Jev Harness demo

A local Next.js App Router application with a dark, full-width React interface. The pure harness in `src/` is shared by the UI and host; it has no provider client or executor.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
# http://127.0.0.1:4173

pnpm build
pnpm start
# Alternate port: pnpm exec next start --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 4198
```

The pinned webpack build uses extension aliases so the package's ESM `.js` imports continue resolving to TypeScript without changing the library contract. No remote fonts, analytics or UI asset services are used.

## One arena

The root page is the Agent arena. `/arena` redirects to `/`; the previous Routing room and `/examples` pages are removed. The pure routing experiments remain available through `pnpm bench:routing`.

Choose an example from four labeled radio cards. Each explains the task's purpose and shows its local run count. Keyboard arrows change the selection; the task preview updates without a request. **Run comparison** starts the agents. Examples are disabled while running, and each lane reports progress independently. Compare and History are views of the same workspace.

Primary details open in a modal drawer over the content: **How the comparison works**, **Explore this run**, **Tool activity**, and **Read full answer**. Opening them preserves the underlying layout. Escape, Close, or the desktop backdrop dismisses the drawer and restores focus. Small screens use the full viewport. Raw receipts and recorded proposals remain one level deeper inside the inspector.

## Key and usage controls

**Settings → Jev API key** exposes the manual override and current key source. Saving activates it immediately; replacing updates it, and **Remove override** restores the server default for the next comparison. It follows the playground's personal-override convention: masked input, save/replace/remove, origin-local `typesafe-api-key-override` storage. The saved value is never filled back into the input. Storage is unencrypted and accessible to same-origin scripts; origins include ports. A personal key overrides the host's server-only `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`. Server keys never reach the browser.

**Usage** opens reported input/output totals, a price estimate and request history for this tab's latest 200 logical Jev calls. Physical requests and additional attempts are counted separately. Session storage preserves scalar telemetry and sanitized attempt ledgers across refresh, without prompts or keys. **Clear local usage history** removes only that telemetry. Input and output totals include all attempts independently; any missing attempt metric keeps that whole-call metric unknown. Reported subtotals and unknown-attempt counts stay visible. Legacy scalar measurements do not acquire a fabricated ledger. Personal and host-key calls are identified separately. CLI usage is shown per arena lane, not mixed into the Jev totals.

The input-only estimate uses the [public $42/billion input-token price](https://typesafe.ai/), checked September 22, 2026. It excludes unknown calls, output pricing, cache discounts and account-specific prices. No account balance, plan or quota is invented.

## Agent comparison

The arena compares **Codex** with **Codex + Jev Harness** on four original synthetic tasks: reading a module, recording a proposed fix, inspecting timeouts and asking about an ambiguous request.

1. Jev routes the fixed task against the known catalog.
2. Two fresh Codex CLI processes start in parallel: the baseline MCP host exposes all fixture tools; the integrated host exposes routed schemas plus host-declared prerequisites. Selecting `propose_patch` also exposes `read_file`, so the agent can inspect the fixture before recording a change. Every prerequisite must remain available and within the per-tool cost limit; otherwise no CLI comparison starts. Jev's selected IDs stay unchanged in the receipt. Available-tool counts include prerequisites, including while the lane is still running.
3. Each lane streams starting, working, tool-call and answer activity with an elapsed timer. Final results appear independently. Cancellation stops both processes.
4. Paired cards lead with available-tool counts, reported input tokens and duration, followed by readable agent answers. The integrated totals include input and routing time from every Jev attempt, with their CLI/Jev components visible. These durations add measured work per lane; they are not the concurrent comparison’s wall-clock time. The headline shows both the input difference and the timing tradeoff when both runs complete and the measurements are known. Long answers have an explicit preview and a full-answer drawer. Tool names and call statuses live in a modal **Tool activity** drawer. Desktop cards share aligned rows; mobile cards stack with compact metrics. A completed CLI with no fixture calls is labeled explicitly. An overlay run inspector offers keyboard-navigable Usage, Tool activity, Jev’s decision and Test setup tabs. Usage bars include Jev input overhead; missing usage stays unknown. Expand Routing attempts for a card per physical request, with usage, status, duration, and exact numeric sum diagnostics. Labeled metrics stack as the panel narrows. Routing failure usage remains visible even if no CLI lane starts. Tool events use a readable timeline, evidence uses probability bars, and raw receipts stay one level deeper.
5. The UI streams progress and shows returned answers, actual MCP calls, CLI-reported input/output/cache tokens, duration and Jev overhead. Download preserves the comparison.

The CLI arena host supports macOS and Linux; Windows is explicitly refused before creating a workspace or starting a process because process-tree cleanup is not implemented there. The browser UI itself remains responsive across device sizes.

Install Codex separately and run `codex login` on the host. The adapter was developed against Codex CLI 0.155.1. It uses the CLI's default model and existing file-based sign-in. Keychain-only authentication is not supported. No CLI credentials are returned to the browser.

Each lane gets a temporary working directory and an auth-only Codex home. Only `auth.json` is copied, with restrictive permissions; configuration, global instructions, memory and plugins are not copied. HOME is isolated too. The adapter disables shell, browser, computer, plugin, app and sub-agent features and selects read-only sandboxing. The host explicitly permits only the three bounded fixture tools through per-tool MCP approval settings; other tools retain the prompt default. The fixture server is required, so startup failure cannot silently turn into a tool-free run. See the [Codex MCP settings](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp). Fixture contents are not included in the agent prompt: only the task and available paths are shared. Source-dependent tasks must use read/inspection tools or explain the missing capability. MCP handlers can return only the selected synthetic fixtures or record a proposal; they cannot read arbitrary files or execute proposed code. The inspector is a deterministic fixture tool, not a second model agent. Temporary directories are removed after completion.

Only fixed case ids are accepted, with no browser-supplied command, cwd, script or model. The host permits one comparison at a time. Each CLI run has time/output bounds, and cancellation terminates its process group, escalating after a short grace period. Provider failures remain visible and do not trigger a mock fallback. Recorded proposals retain their path, diff and rationale in the tool trace and download, with `applied: false`. The MCP host limits handler execution to the first 100 calls and retained proposal content to 256 KB per lane; later/excess proposals are rejected rather than claimed as recorded. No model-proposed patch is applied, tested or committed.

Cleanup also terminates descendants that outlive a completed, failed or
interrupted CLI parent.
Answers use streaming UTF-8 decoding so chunk boundaries preserve multilingual
text. Request-body reads stop on browser cancellation.

The lanes run concurrently after routing. Shared resource contention can affect timing. Both lanes have the same task, fixture, CLI settings and default model, but independent model trajectories and cache effects. Exposed-tool selection is the treatment; this does not gate all operations in a general-purpose production agent. One run does not establish quality, accuracy, latency or cost improvements. Task quality is not scored automatically.

## Lessons from a simulation

After a comparison settles, **Lessons learned** shows a short takeaway and a recommended next step. Opening it reveals an overlay with prioritized recommendations; only the first starts expanded. Each separates **Observed**, **Try next** and **How to evaluate**. Reported measurements stay behind a second disclosure. The History action closes the overlay and opens the matching example's saved runs.

The analysis is deterministic and local: it makes no model or provider call. It uses this run's recorded metrics, routing outcome and tool events, including Jev input and routing time. It checks both lanes for rejected calls, missing traces and absent tool evidence before suggesting performance tuning. Incomplete, failed, cancelled or unknown outcomes lead to evidence-recovery guidance rather than a claimed win. Clarification remains a valid routing outcome.

Recommendations can cover routing overhead, catalog distinctions, unused exposure, cache differences and inconsistent output length. **This arena** steps can be evaluated here; **Host experiment** steps describe changes to test in the integrating host, not controls that this fixed demo silently modifies. Required schemas, validation, permissions and execution boundaries remain intact. Inspect answers against the fixture, repeat comparable runs and track changed setups separately. One simulation does not establish correctness, causality or cost improvement.

Lessons are regenerated from the original snapshot when a saved run is reopened and are included in the comparison download as `lessons`, with `analysisVersion`, `source: local-rules`, and the source `runId`. They do not consume answer text as instructions or change the local history format. See the [lessons verification record](verification/arena-lessons-2026-09-22.json).

## Adapt and assess

The **Integrate** tab provides a copyable/downloadable agent brief, shadow/lean adoption stages and an evaluation checklist. It does not change live Arena settings or start requests. After a settled run, open **Check the answers before comparing performance** to add human ratings and a next-experiment note. History reports review coverage and optionally filters its chart to pairs marked Meets task; every saved run remains listed. The original evidence stays unchanged, and exports mark annotations as human-supplied. Read the [complete integration guide](integration.md) and the [UI review](verification/harness-integration-ui-audit-2026-09-22.md).

## Local results and trends

Each settled request creates a versioned snapshot of the task and synthetic files, routing receipt, full returned answers, proposals, tool events, reported usage, original start/end timestamps and completion status. Complete, partial, cancelled and failed runs remain inspectable. A reload restores the latest known example without making a provider request. Reopening or downloading a saved result also makes no request.

History uses origin-local `jev-arena-history-v1` storage, separate from the API key and tab usage log. It retains the newest 30 runs within 2 MB of serialized UTF-8, evicting oldest runs first. Oversized individual results are not silently truncated. Storage errors are visible; the current snapshot stays available in memory for download, while previous readable history is preserved. Corrupt or unsupported history must be explicitly cleared before new saves. Cross-tab changes update the UI without cancelling an active comparison; Web Locks serialize mutations where supported. Without Web Locks, overlapping cross-tab writes can lose the last competing write.

Input and duration trends pair completed lanes only when the fixture id, task, files and harness setup revision match. Input includes CLI plus Jev reported input; duration includes CLI plus routing time. Missing values, partial runs and older setups stay in the list but are excluded from chart medians. Exact values and dates are available in each keyboard-accessible row. Chart spacing follows run order, not elapsed wall time. One sample is labeled a starting point. CLI defaults, model trajectories and cache effects may vary; history is observation, not a quality or cost benchmark. Single-request controls retain setup 6. Recovery-enabled runs use setup 7; the saved `routingTransport` policy, cap, and timeout must also match before runs enter the same trend. Older snapshots remain readable.

History is unencrypted local evidence, not authenticated provenance or an account-wide database. It contains no API-key fields. Clear local history requires confirmation and leaves the API key and usage log intact; clearing usage leaves comparisons intact. Saved results from another port or device are not synchronized.

The chart continues observing its size after an assessment filter removes and
recreates it, including later viewport changes.

## Local host boundary

The Next.js API requires loopback Host/Origin for live operations, bounded JSON bodies and explicit POST requests. `/api/route` rebuilds its payload from the fixed catalog, pins `jev-1.13.0`, validates the full distribution and strips provider error bodies. It limits physical provider requests, including recovery, to 30/minute and two concurrent logical calls per process across tabs and keys. These are local safeguards, not authentication or account-wide quotas. Do not forward this local app publicly.

Provider requests reject redirects instead of forwarding payloads to another
destination. The review-experiment host bounds fetch and response reads under
one deadline, including transports that ignore cancellation, and records
actual received bytes.

The demo selects `probability_sum_only_v1` in
`examples/routing/host-policy.ts` through the configurable `createLiveHandler`: at most three total identical requests for a sole
probability-sum defect, under one 45-second deadline and a 64,000-byte response
cap. Valid answers and other failures stop immediately. The UI does not choose
this policy. The reusable adapter still defaults to `none`. The
[frozen comparison](routing-evaluation/2026-09-26-host-recovery.md) passes its
fixed routing and blinded output-quality gates. Every first response was valid,
so the live results establish no observed recovery benefit.

The Arena streams sanitized attempt snapshots before its terminal usage event.
If delivery is interrupted, history/download retains the observed partial ledger
and an unknown total, not an assumed single request. Notifications that never
arrived cannot be reconstructed by the browser; durable host journaling is not
implemented. The lane schedule and CLI isolation remain unchanged.

Only supplied task text and fixed tool descriptions reach TypeSafe. The arena sends its synthetic task and files to Codex. Do not use private repository content, personal memory or credentials as tasks. Nothing in the exported pure package has execution authority.

## Verification

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm check:secrets
```

Tests use fake provider/CLI transports and a real local synthetic MCP process; they never consume provider credits. Browser verifiers accept an existing Playwright Page without adding a second test dependency. See `scripts/verify-arena-browser.mjs`, `scripts/verify-arena-history-browser.mjs`, `scripts/verify-arena-controls-browser.mjs`, `scripts/verify-arena-settings-browser.mjs`, `scripts/verify-arena-lessons-browser.mjs` and `scripts/verify-arena-integration-browser.mjs`. Run each verifier in a fresh browser context. The integration entry point is `verifyArenaIntegration(page, baseURL, screenshotDir?)`. The Settings and lessons entry points are `verifyArenaSettings(page, baseURL, screenshotDir?)` and `verifyArenaLessons(page, baseURL, screenshotDir?)`; pass the context's Page, the running demo URL and an optional screenshot directory. The Settings verifier checks the manual key lifecycle with synthetic credentials and intercepted requests; see the [Settings verification record](verification/arena-key-settings-2026-09-22.json).

The [arena history verification](verification/arena-history-2026-09-22.json) records offline unit, browser and build checks for the sole arena, example selection, overlays, persistence, unknown/partial outcomes and responsive layouts. Recorded runs live in [verification/](verification/). Automated browser checks and screenshot inspection are not human keyboard-only or VoiceOver acceptance. Cross-browser device testing and a repeated live benchmark remain outstanding.
