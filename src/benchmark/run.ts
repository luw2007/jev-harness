/**
 * Fixture bench runner: propose -> validate -> (Jev review) -> decide -> receipt.
 *
 * This is benchmark machinery for synthetic fixtures, not an agent runtime or a
 * host. "Execute" means recording the proposal as pending in the receipt.
 * Nothing applies a patch, runs fixture tests, or executes proposed code.
 * `base` mode is validate-only and uses the benchmark-only `decideBase`; it is
 * never a fallback for a failed review.
 *
 * Extracted from TypeSafeAI/typesafe-playground `lib/harness/run.ts` at
 * 6fe5967dc020521a0731682b06c4d8eeeab95ffb, adapted to the hardened `decide()`.
