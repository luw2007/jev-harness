/**
 * Labeled mock transport. It returns the scripted noul probabilities stored on
 * the matching fixture. These are demonstration values, not measurements of
 * Jev; every receipt produced through it should carry `source: "mock"`.
 *
 * The lookup key is the proposal inside the request state. Labels stay on the
 * fixture side of this table and are never added to the payload.
